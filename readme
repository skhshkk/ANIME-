# 🎌 Anime Recommendation System

A content-based anime recommendation web app built with Python and Streamlit. Users can filter by genres, minimum rating, and episode count to discover anime that match their preferences.

## 📖 Overview

Anime fans often struggle to find new series that fit their tastes. This project leverages a content-based filtering approach to recommend anime based on:

- **Genre Matching**: Select one or more genres (e.g., Action, Fantasy).
- **Rating Filter**: Set a minimum rating threshold.
- **Episode Count Range**: Choose a range (e.g., 1–50 episodes).
- **Top-K Selection**: Display the top N results (5–20).

Recommendations are ranked by how many selected genres they share and then by rating. Each result shows the title, genres, rating, episode count, type (TV, Movie, etc.), and a link to MyAnimeList.
